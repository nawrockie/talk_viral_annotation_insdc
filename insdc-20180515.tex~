\begin{itemize}
\item general method for annotating existing and new viral genome
  sequences for a species using trusted annotation for that species (e.g. RefSeq)
\item identify interesting characteristics that Virus Variation can
  allow users to sort/select based on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item identification of high quality sequences that meet specific expectations
  \item identification of sequences that deviate from expectations in
    various ways
    \begin{itemize}

\textbf{Future directions}

\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Annotate more species (Norovirus, Zika, and Ebola are currently \\ being checked).

\item Long term:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Protein homology searches to supplement or replace nucleotide searches
\item  Given any viral sequence, find its nearest RefSeq
\item  Annotate structural RNA features (Infernal is well-suited for this)
\item  More robust solution to the problem of finding origin sequences
\item  Multiple alignment based homology searches 
\end{itemize}

\item Short term: we have a 36 item TODO list that we agreed to with
  J. Rodney \\ Brister's group on April 12, which includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Completed items (including analysis of West Nile annotations)
  \item Loading and using our pipeline's annotations in the Virus Variation
    database for Dengue and West Nile
  \item Reviewing Ebola and Norovirus annotations
  \item Comparing our Ebola annotations to existing annotations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
